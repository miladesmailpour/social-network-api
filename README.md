## How to Contribute

Challenges repository
This is an open-source project which has Licensed by MIT which allows you to contribute and used open source codes used in this repo (All Branches).
More info: https://g.co/kgs/QWcHhF

- Branches are named as modules [n] and each one of them is a unique challenge.
- Master Branch contains the last solved challenge. (the read me you are reading through, it is a default guide when NO challenge is available to help you do a pre-setup.)

# How to use the module and deploy

- Clone the repo and make it own

  # Https URL :

        git clone https://github.com/miladesmailpour/challanges.git

  # ssh URL :

        git clone git@github.com:miladesmailpour/challanges.git

  # Checking the fetch/pull and push URL :

        git remote -v

  # Modifing origin URL :

        git remote add origin [https/ssh URL of your repo] https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo

  # Verifing the fetch/pull and push URL :

        git remote -v https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories

  # Chacking the status of local :

        git status

        "if local NOT updated"
        git add .
        git commit -m "[your comment]"
        git push origin master/main

- Checkout the module (the challenge you want to use and deploy)
  # Checkout to the desired challenge :
       git checkout module[n]
  # Verifing :
       git status
  # [Make the change you wish to have]
       What do you think needed to improve?
  # Commiting to local and updating the GitHub repo:
         git add .
         git commit -m "[your comment]"
         git push origin [your module name]
- Moving Modules to Master Branch and deploying:
  # Creating a pull request to update the master/main :
       https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request
  # Deploy through the GitHub :
